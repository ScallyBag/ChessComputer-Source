# ChessComputer-Source
Source code for ChessComputer
## Work in Progress

### To build
navigate to the src directory
```
make
./chessByte (name will change in the future)
```

All file need to be in the same directory as chessByte

- polyglot.ini
- bookfish.bin (change polyglot.ini file to enable book read)

Button input is emulated at the moment.

Hardware display is working.
